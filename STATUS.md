# Status

PER-332 agent adapter implementation and verification are complete.

- Added the provider-neutral launch, status, result, cancellation, and resume
  metadata contract.
- Added Codex terminal response normalization outside the core contract.
- Added a deterministic scripted fake covering all terminal paths and lifecycle
  invariants.
- Verification: `npm run verify` passed 7 tests, `node --test
  test/configuration-contract.test.mjs` passed 3 tests,
  `./scripts/verify-per-323.sh` passed, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Pull request: https://github.com/1solomonwakhungu/superset-agent-orchestrator/pull/5
- Verified PR head: `8349e99e0515168c66b672e88d7469faf7d3fa95`.
- Merge commit: `1a2e61ec2dac707f6b180b46490f0f441e102fe8`.
- GitHub reported the exact head clean and mergeable with no required checks.
- Next: reconcile PER-332 in Linear.

PER-341 startup reconciliation and batch recovery are complete.

- Added durable startup and periodic reconciliation without worker relaunch.
- Added recent-session, named batch reopen, and recovery diagnostic MCP tools.
- Added strict state validation, process identity checks, serialized synced writes,
  and orphan, unknown-outcome, and missing-result diagnostics.
- Verification: `npm run verify` passed 13 tests, `node --test
  test/configuration-contract.test.mjs` passed 3 tests, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Pull request: https://github.com/1solomonwakhungu/superset-agent-orchestrator/pull/7
- Verified PR head: `3a217ac7e2acd2bd36d41bad43e6383666ac94c4`.
- GitHub reported the exact head clean and mergeable with no required checks.
- Next: merge PR 7 and reconcile PER-341 in Linear.

PER-337 supported Superset discovery implementation is complete.

- Added structured parsers for projects, workspaces, local host status, agent
  presets, and CLI versions.
- Added explicit `--local` routing, host correlation, version probing,
  per-command timeouts, isolated child environments, and normalized errors.
- Child commands use argument arrays with `shell: false`; large JSON responses
  use permission-restricted temporary capture and guaranteed cleanup.
- Verification: `npm run verify` passed 22 tests, including a real Superset
  1.16.1 smoke test for all documented discovery schemas.
- Next: open, verify, and merge the PER-337 pull request.
