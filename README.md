# Agency availability monitor

Read-only HTTPS synthetic monitoring for the agency properties. A run records
HTTP status, latency, TLS certificate expiry, and a configured content
signature. It also evaluates per-service SLOs and maintains deduplicated
incident and recovery history.

The repository deliberately contains no scheduler and sends no notifications.
Run it manually or from CI. Runtime state and reports are local artifacts and
must not be published from a private environment.

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer is the only requirement.

```sh
python3 -m agency_monitor check \
  --config config/services.json \
  --state var/state.json \
  --output var/status.json

python3 -m agency_monitor report \
  --config config/services.json \
  --state var/state.json \
  --output var/weekly-report.md
```

`check` exits nonzero if a service fails or breaches its availability SLO.
The JSON output is always written, including on failure. To keep CI synthetic
checks network-independent, use the checked-in fixture configuration:

```sh
python3 -m agency_monitor check --config tests/fixtures/services.json \
  --state /tmp/agency-state.json --output /tmp/agency-status.json
```

## Configuration

Each service has an HTTPS URL, expected status, regular-expression content
signature, timeout, certificate warning window, and rolling SLO policy. The
production URLs are private operational configuration, even though the
properties themselves are publicly reachable. Do not include cluster names,
internal addresses, credentials, or tunnel identifiers.

See [`docs/incident-runbook.md`](docs/incident-runbook.md) for diagnosis and
recovery procedures.
