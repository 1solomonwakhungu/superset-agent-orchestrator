# superset-agent-orchestrator

Local-first MCP server for durable orchestration of parallel coding agents through
Superset.

## Configuration contract

The portable configuration schema is published at
[`config/orchestrator.schema.json`](config/orchestrator.schema.json). Discovery,
precedence, environment isolation, diagnostics, and redaction behavior are defined
in [`docs/configuration-and-discovery.md`](docs/configuration-and-discovery.md).

Run the zero-dependency contract checks with:

```sh
node --test test/configuration-contract.test.mjs
```

## Architecture

- [Authoritative session state machine](docs/session-state-machine.md)

## Agent adapter boundary

`AgentAdapter` isolates core orchestration from coding-agent lifecycle APIs. It provides launch, status, terminal result, cancellation, and resume metadata operations. Provider-specific response formats are normalized in adapter modules before they reach core domain code.

`FakeAgentAdapter` accepts ordered run scripts and a caller-controlled clock. Integration tests can therefore drive queued, running, succeeded, failed, and cancelled paths without timing or network dependencies.

Run `npm run verify` to type-check the adapter contract and execute its integration tests.
